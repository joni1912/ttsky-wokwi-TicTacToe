## How it works

It works by Multiplexing 9 RGB-LEDs and alternating each RGB-LED Color when a button is clicked. When a player wins a RGB-LED will light up according to the winner colour.

## How to test

You can test it by wire it up according to the wokwi project. You will also need to set the clock to about 100 Hz. 

## External hardware

9 Push-Buttons, 10 RGB-LEDs (Common Cathode) -> 9 for displaying the game and 1 for displaying the winner
