## How it works

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using multiplexed RGB LEDs. Each of the 9 game fields is displayed using a common-cathode RGB LED. When a player presses a button assigned to a cell, the logic evaluates the current game state and updates only that cell. The LED color indicates the player (e.g., red for Player X, green/blue for Player O, depending on your configuration).
When a winning combination is detected, the logic evaluates the grid and drives an additional RGB LED to show the winner’s color.

## How to test

Wire the circuit according to the Wokwi design (push-buttons, RGB LEDs, connectors).
Set the simulation clock to approximately 100 Hz (or faster if preferred).
Press any of the 9 buttons to place a move.
The LED for that position lights up in the corresponding player color.
Continue placing moves alternately.
When a player wins, the winner LED displays their color.
